=======================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/derekjbernard/ansible-wp-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/derekjbernard/ansible-role-wp-cli)

Ansible role for installing [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org)

Features:
* Installs WP-CLI
* Installs [WP-CLI packages](https://wp-cli.org/commands/package/)

Credits

I was inspired by [Simon B채rlocher's](https://sbaerlocher.ch) excellent [ansible wp-cli role](https://www.github.com/sbaerlocher/ansible.wp-cli). His wp-cli role was the best wp-cli role project I found. Clean code and working travis tests. It also installs wp-cli packages which AFAIK was unique to his project. I am adding that feature to this project, so I'd like to thank Simon for his great work.
